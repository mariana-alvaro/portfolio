    <p>If someone told you to create an educational app for children, what would spring to mind? How would you make an
      app both <b>educational and fun? </b>
      Images? Bright colors? Exploding science experiments? Dinosaurs? <br><br>

      This is what my teammates and I were trying to explore. For this project, we had to choose a startup and design a
      user interface (UI) for that startup without looking
      at their existing UI. The only thing we could work off of was their concept. <br><br>

      The startup we chose is <a href="https://www.tappityapp.com/">Tappity</a>, an app for kids which teaches 100+
      science topics with experiments and games. The app is specifically for children aged 4-10 and explores topics,
      such as
      space, animals, the human body etc.<br><br>
      In this article, we're going to walk you through our brainstorming, how we created an interactive prototype, and
      an analysis of our
      results after conducting user testing. <br> <br>

      My teammates were Deniz Ozturk, Nicole Cid, and Sharon Alexander &hearts; <br> <br>
    </p>

  <!-- sketching + wireframing -->
  <div class="subtitle" id="sketching-wireframing">
    Sketching + Wireframing
  </div>
  <div class="heading"> <b>Sketches </b></div>
  <div class="paragraph">
    <p> First, we made many 5-minute sketches to get the ideas flowing. We tried different layouts and designs,
      and brainstormed which elements users would be able to interact with.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="image"><img src="iterative_pics/sketches.svg" width="900"></div>
  <div class="image"><img src="iterative_pics/sketches2.svg" width="900"></div>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>
      Before creating low-fidelity wireframes, we discussed our individual sketches and decided the following:
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph">
    <ul>
      <li> We thought that it would be fun and engaging for kids to let them create and customize
        their own avatar.
        Instead of a human avatar, we wanted a more interesting and gender-neutral creature. Very quickly it became
        crystal clear - it had to be a dinosaur!
        We then decided that for consistency, the app's icon should be a dinosaur as well. </li>
      <li> We decided to cheer up our login page with a "knock, knock, who's there" joke which prompts the user to
        choose between logging in as the parent or the child. </li>
      <li> We knew that we wanted to split the homepage into three categories: games, experiments, and educational
        videos. However, we spent a lot of time deciding which word to use
        for educational videos. We thought that "learning" or "classroom" would put off children so we went with
        "Discover". </li>
      <li> Initially, we planned to have a "Games" button which would lead directly to a path made up of individual
        games across different themes e.g. animals, space, machines, etc.
        Once a child completes all games for a specific theme, they would arrive at an endpoint where they would collect
        some sort of gear for their avatar. We believe this would incentivize
        children to continue playing and we used the same logic for educational videos and experiments.
      </li>
      <li> Later on, we realized that it would be more intuititve and organized to divide the games into topics and then
        create
        a topics page before navigating the user to the games path. For example, if the user clicks on "Animals", it
        would take them to
        a path made up of only animal games. This would also allow kids to choose which games they want to play.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="heading"><b>Low-Fidelity Wireframes</b></div>
  <div class="paragraph">After combining our ideas from our sketches, we created low-fidelity wireframes using Balsamiq to better visualize our chosen design.

    After completing our wireframes, it was time to turn our ideas into a high-fidelity interactive mockup to test how it would look from a user's perspective. And here you

  <div class="heading" style="color: #41b3a3"><b>Critique Feedback</b></div>
  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>The mockup you see above is our final draft after receiving feedback from Nikolas Klein, an industry Product
      Designer, and other students in our UI/UX
      class at Brown.
      The following is a summary of the critique: </p>
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph">
    <ul>
      <li><b>Make it more clear which is the parent dinosaur and which is the child and use this parent-child
          relationship throughout the app.</b>
        Originally, on page 1 (login page), both the parent and child dinosaurs were green. We later changed the parent
        to orange and for consistency, we also
        made this change on page 8 and 9 to the astronaut and safari tourguide dinosaurs. This makes it seem as if the
        child's parent is cheering them on by the "You are doing great!" speech bubble on pages 8 and 9. </li>
      <li><b> In the game path, highlight where the dinosaur is standing to make it more clear as to which game the
          child is meant to complete.</b> We decided to highlight the game icon with a drop shadow. </li>
      <li>Overall, Nikolas and our peers liked the choice of colors and graphics and said that the app was easy to
        navigate. </li>
    </ul>

    User Testing
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>
      After creating our interactive high-fidelity mockup, how do we know if it's actually user friendly? This is where
      user testing comes into play.
      We submitted our mockup to a remote user testing service <a
        href="https://www.usertesting.com/">(usertesting.com)</a> and had 3 users test our interface prototype.
      We gave all 3 users the following tasks and scenario:
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="heading" style="color: #41b3a3"><b>Scenario</b></div>
  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>Imagine you're a child and you want to play a "Space" game and then an "Animals" game. Keep in
      mind
      that this is a mockup made with prototyping software and not a real website. However, like a real application, you
      will be able to interact with elements on each page to help you achieve your goal. Since it's a prototype, you
      won't
      actually be able to play a game but they would be included in the real application.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="heading" style="color: #41b3a3"><b>Task</b></div>
  <div class="paragraph">
    <p> Play a "Space" game and then an "Animals" game.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="heading" style="color: #41b3a3"><b>Subtasks</b></div>
  <div class="paragraph">
    <ol>
      <li> Without leaving the homepage, what are your initial impressions of the website? Explain your answer.</li>
      <li>Find where you can play a "Space" game.</li>
      <li>Now, find where you can play an "Animals" game.</li>
      <li>What 3 words would you use to describe this application? Explain your answer.</li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <div class="heading" style="color: #41b3a3"><b>Results</b></div>
  <div class="paragraph"> <b>NOTE: when creating our test on usertesting.com, we chose tablet as the device that users
      should
      use. However, we were unaware that despite specifying this, users without tablets would still receive this test.
      This caused formatting issues for 2/3 of our test users, since they were trying to open up the prototype on a
      computer/mobile instead of a tablet. If we were to conduct this test
      again, we would either specify that using a tablet is highly recommended in the scenario or
      change our prototype so that it is responsive to different devices.</b>
